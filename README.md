Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture:

Controllers

Handle HTTP requests and responses.

Services

Contain the business logic and abstract database operations from controllers.

Entities

Represent the database models.

Models

DTOs used for request and response mapping between the UI and services.

Data

Contains the Entity Framework DbContext used for database access.

Views

Razor views used to render the MVC UI.

Database Design

The application models a many-to-many relationship between Clients and Contacts.

Client
   │
   │
ClientContact (Join Table)
   │
   │
Contact

This allows:

A Client to have multiple Contacts

A Contact to belong to multiple Clients
